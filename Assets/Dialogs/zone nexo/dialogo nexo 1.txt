I'll start from the beginning. My name is <color=#b00e26> Alice </color> and as I told you before I am the security protocol of this shelter.

But something terrible happened, while I was doing some security checks, I found a minor vulnerability and I tried fixing it.

The thing is ... That instead of fixing it I made it worse ~.~

So therefore a breach opened and almost instantly a bunch of AIs attacked the shelter.

Every zone in this shelter is hijacked by an AI, but now, I am not strong enough to fight them.

So, I need your help to beat all the AIs that invaded the shelter so I can fix the breach.

I managed to get access to the foundry, but I can't beat the AI myself as I lack a physical body.

I am convinced that once you beat all the malicious AIs, we will be able to fix the problem.
